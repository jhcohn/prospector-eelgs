input_plot_test.py: file for bulding prospector model and then testing input SED and chi_sq; defunct

make_all_plots.py: calls uvj.py, print_sfh.py, and then also prints SED and chi^2 on same plot from pickled files produced by output_all.py; can also call widths.py
-Running with: python make_all_plots.py --obj=7730 --field=cosmos --base=_newbins

make_fig1.py: using to make Figure 2 for the paper. Shh. I know.

noelg_multirun_params.py: eelg_multirun_params.py, but with add_dust_emission turned on (also currently using different SFH bins). NOW changed into eelg_fixedmet_params.py but with gaslogz held fixed and dust on. NOW fixing metallicity based on Gallazzi et al. 2005 stellar mass-metallicity relation.

nonparameteric_sfh_example_params.py: Joel's example of nonparametric SFH param file, off of which I'm basing eelg_npSFH_params.py

one_stack.py: same as smart_stack.py, but for just one sample (rather than side-by-side subplots)

only_sfh.py: modified from Joel's extra_output.py, with lots of things cut/print statements added; defunct

output.py: improved output_all.py; creates all _out.pkl files needed for make_all_plots.py and also includes ways to print out tracefig, cornerfig, kl divergence, and chisq.
-Running with: python output.py --outname=1824_cosmos_fixedmet_1501707076_mcmc.h5 --parfile=eelg_fixedmet_params.py

-Running with: python print_sfh.py --obj=1824 --field=cosmos --base=_newbins

prosp_dutils.py: code from Joel for plotting SFH (and other extras); I've edited this one a fair bit to figure out what's going on; defunct

prosp_dutils_orig.py: code from Joel for plotting SFH (and other extras); I've left this one untouched

prospector.py: prospector python file with initial guess SED plotting code added

prospector_nest.py: new file from bd-j prospector
