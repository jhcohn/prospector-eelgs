Git readme - created 20 April 2017 (Jonathan Cohn)

Files:
eelg_5bins_params.py: same as eelg_emission_params.py, but tweak using different arrangements/numbers of SFH bins

eelg_all_fields_params.py: same as eelg_emission_params.py, but can use for CDFS, COSMOS, and UDS galaxies, rather than just COSMOS

eelg_emission_params.py: same as eelg_npSFH_params.py, now with nebular emission turned on

eelg_multirun_params.py: same as eelg_emission_params.py, but now with field and objname as command line arguments

eelg_npSFH_params.py: param file for running prospector fits on EELGs, using nonparametric SFHs

eelg_quickstart_params.py: same as eelg_emission_params.py, but skip do_Powell process; start run by using previous best fit values as input initial parameter values

fast_mimic_params_latest.py: latest iteration of parameter file for running FAST-like fits in Prospector

input_plot_test.py: file for bulding prospector model and then testing input SED and chi_sq

model_test.py: load model, test lnp of initial model given different values of metallicity

nonparameteric_sfh_example_params.py: Joel's example of nonparametric SFH param file, off of which I'm basing eelg_npSFH_params.py

only_sfh.py: modified from Joel's extra_output.py, with lots of things cut/print statements added

print_sfh.py: prints SFH from pickled file produced by sfh_output.py

prosp_dutils.py: code from Joel for plotting SFH (and other extras); I've edited this one a fair bit to figure out what's going on

prosp_dutils_orig.py: code from Joel for plotting SFH (and other extras); I've left this one untouched

prospector.py: prospector python file with initial guess SED plotting code added

prospector_nest.py: new file from bd-j prospector

quickgrab.py: simple code cannibalized from Prospector tutorial for plotting Prospector output

sfh_output.py: modified from Joel's extra_output.py for creating and pickling SFH

sfh_plot.py: copied from Joel's extra_output.py, for outputting the SFH, with minimal changes to Joel's code
